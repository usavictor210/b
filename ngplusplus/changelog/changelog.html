		<h2>February 2020 -> March 2020 - The Beginning</h2>
		<list>
		<li>Started work on NG+2 Respecced.</li>
    <li>A new row of achievements spanning from the original endgame of NG++ to early Quantum has been created.</li>
    <li>Unstable Dilation has begun being worked on. This will coincide with the Time Rift.</li>
    <li>Added lots of news tickers. Most of them are dumb.</li>
    <li>Begun organizing the spaghetti code that is game.js.</li>
    <li>Quantum is being worked on, but the buttons don't actually work because I didn't implement them yet.</li>
    <li>You can see how many eternities and infinities you get from their respective button once you can get 1e100,000 of their respective point.</li>
    <li>Going to fix "I'm so meta" import later since I need to make sure everything is stabilized in Quantum first.</li>
    <li>Begun NG+ v3: You start with 1,012,680 eternities (this may be changed on quantum to give you max TS191 and EU2 boost with 1,012,680 eternities but give you only 100 eternities), 1 trillion banked infinities, </li>
