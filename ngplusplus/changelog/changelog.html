		<h2>February 2020 -> March 2020 - The Beginning</h2>
		<list>
		<li>Started work on NG+2 Respecced.</li>
    <li>A new row of achievements spanning from the original endgame of NG++ to early Quantum has been created.</li>
    <li>Unstable Dilation has begun being worked on. This will coincide with the Time Rift.</li>
    <li>Added lots of news tickers. Most of them are dumb.</li>
    <li>Rephrased many of vanilla game's descriptions for each mechanic, challenge and achievement.</li>
    <li>Begun organizing the spaghetti code that is game.js.</li>
    <li>Quantum is being worked on, but the buttons don't actually work because I didn't implement them yet.</li>
    <li>You can see how many eternities and infinities you get from their respective button once you can get 1e100,000 of their respective point.</li>
    <li>Going to fix "I'm so meta" import later since I need to make sure everything is stabilized in Quantum first.</li>
    <li>Begun NG+ v3: You start with 1,012,680 eternities (this may be changed on quantum to give you max TS191 and EU2 boost with 1,012,680 eternities but give you only 100 eternities), 1 trillion banked infinities, start with 1,024x IP mult (which resets later), start with all normal challenges completed, and also start with "Fake News" and "Don't you dare sleep". All NG+ v2 changes persist.</li>
    <li>"Long lasting relationship" and "Eternities are the new infinity" have been given rewards: Infinity Dimensions are more powerful based on EC1's reward, and you gain 100x eternitied stat on longer eternities (reward taken from <a href="https://soul147.github.io/">AD Ultimate</a> and tweaked to balance for NG+2R).</li>
    <li>"In the grim darkness of the far endgame" has been given a reward to remove active/passive/idle RG nerfs.</li>
    <li>"I'm so meta" has been given a reward to unlock the dilation upgrade autobuyer.</li>
    <li>"Meta-boosting to the max" has been given a better picture.</li>
    <li>Changed the changelog files and took Aarex's CSS for them.</li>
    <li>Made EU2 actually change it's formula visually when you get "The cap is a million, not a trillion".</li>
    <li>Max all will instead max all meta dimensions when you unlock them. Speaking of meta dimensions, their autobuyers are unlocked at 1e25x of each multiplier for each MD ("I never meta-dimension I didn't like").</li>
    <li>Removed all Kong variables and changed the Shop to the Quantum tab.</li>
    <li>...and that's only the beginning. There will be more. MORE.</li>
