IDEAS

1. secret lab: secret lab produces w and z bosons that buff something. w and z bosons are generated by large processes and will unlock some repeatable upgrades.
w and z bosons can be used in the universe and creation. you can research stuff in the lab to grant permanent buffs and unlock features and quality of life measures.
(1e3 QK -> 1e100+ QK)

2. universe: upon reaching a certain point in lab research, you can start creating a universe. a universe requires massive amounts of antimatter, as well as any particles that you have.
this universe can be altered to help affect antimatter production, buff a certain feature, etc.
of course, universes will be big, so you have to make the biggest universe possible. the larger universe, the bigger rewards.

3. neutron star: 
"You can sacrifice all your current gluons, DT, or meta-antimatter to the neutron star.

total gluon sac
log2(total DT sac.max(1))
log2(total MAM sac.max(1))

pairwise products give the three types of boson

each type of boson boosts one of the three types of galaxy by 1 + bosons / 1000

gluon * dt = w^+ bosons which boost normal galaxies
gluon * mam = w^- bosons which boost dilated galaxies
dt * mam = z^0 bosons which boost replicanti galaxies

bosons = floor(product^(1 / 8))"

the bigger the star, the more powerful it is. however, at enough pressure (given from sacrificing), the star will cause a supernova, granting a permanent buff but wil
