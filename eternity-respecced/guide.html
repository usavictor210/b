    This is just the bare bones of the guide. Also, this is inspired by FE000000's guide. It'll look better later.

    Eternity Respecced is a mod of Antimatter Dimensions. It starts at Eternity. You should play the original Antimatter Dimensions first before playing this. This contains massive spoilers, even though Infinity is not directly stated.
    Even though it starts at Eternity, the Respecced concept starts to get involved where you don't have the overpowered advantages of the original Time Studies:
    There's less crazy numbers, less time studies, but on the bright side you don't have some Finnish guy betraying you, and the game is more balanced, but slow. There is no scaling, just wisely put areas of progression.
    <br><br>
    As of this point, the mod is currently updated to the Intergalactic Update. The endgame is currently very vast. usavictor worked hard on trying to get all this stuff stable.

<h3>The Beginning, to 100 Eternities</h3>
<p>
    The beginning refers to the very start of Eternity. When you first Eternity, is where we start this guide. Everything before it is unchanged, to an extent. If you have been to Eternity before, feel free to import "et in aeternum ego" (1 eternity), or "skip to 7 eternities" (7 eternities, that's redundant).<br>
</p>
<p">Once you reach Eternity, you will unlock Time Dimensions and Time Studies. However, if you look at your newly unlocked tabs, there are still four Time Dimensions, but you have access to only four Time Studies! ...well, as of right now. Later on, you will be able to unlock more Time Studies, in pairs.
    <br>
</p>
<h4><b>Basics of the time study</b></h4>
<p>Time studies work differently: You no longer can buy many time studies in a tree. Instead, they have essentially turned into upgrades for certain aspects of gameplay. Even though you may be thinking that this is a problem, these are powerful enough to go on your own.<br>The four Time Studies you have access to right now are:</p>
<p>Sacrifice is stronger (roughly 15% first time, total effect double-logarithmic in times bought)<br>You get 10% more tickspeed upgrades from time dimensions (not considering multiplier increase)<br>Replicanti multiplier to ID is 25% stronger<br>Dimension boost multiplier is incremented</p>
<p>Unlike in the original Antimatter Dimensions, time studies will increase in cost for how many times you have purchased a specific study. This is in increments of one TT/purchase. This will quickly limit your options as you don't have many TT yet. For now, you should try to get at least one purchased TS each. (1/1/1/1)</p>
<p>You want to get Dimension Boost increments early on, then focus on the Replicanti multiplier to Infinity Dimensions. Sacrifice and free tickspeed upgrades are lower on the list, but getting some of them won't hurt. However, Replicanti isn't available until 1e140 IP. Thus, you should buy wisely to get the most effectiveness.</p>
<p>For now, grind Eternities: Your first few Eternities will be slow, but the time required will quickly be reduced after a couple of them. These will take a couple hours, but will take less and less time. Going for 7 Eternities will be important as you no longer have to deal with the Infinity Challenges, which helps a lot with speed in the early Eternity stage.</p>
<p>You may want to get 2 EP (1e349 IP), as it is easier to reach, and you can quickly buy upgrades to further speed up Eternities. Eternity Upgrade 1 and 2 are good choices: When getting Eternity Upgrade 1, get some extra EP to get a boost from it right away, and do the same for Eternity Upgrade 2 so you have at least some multiplier left for Infinity Dimensions. Getting your first Second Time Dimension should be a priority after that, which only costs 10 EP and can be easily achieved in multiple Eternities. Once you feel confident that you can make progress beyond this point, go for long runs to get more TT and get closer to the next goal.</p>
<p>There isn't much to say here as grinding Eternities will take a while. Your first 100 are the longest, but now will be able to take minutes at this point. During this time, you could go for the Third Time Dimension at 100 EP. Note that once you have at least 50 Eternities, you may try pushing for "The swarm" to unlock replicanti galaxy power control.</p>
<h3>Early Eternity Era to Replicanti Galaxy Power Control</h3>
<p>Once you are confident in doing long runs, the game really begins. Soon, you'll need to push longer to get more EP, and get your first EP multiplier. However, there is something much more significant. Your current significant goal at this point, is to unlock replicanti galaxy power control. This is achieved by getting "The swarm" achievement, which requires you to get 10 replicanti galaxies within the 15 seconds of the Infinity (according to the game's code). Getting this achievement isn't easy yet, as at your current progression standpoint, you will need more IP (at least e900) to get enough upgrades to allow replicanti to replicate enough to get 1 replicanti galaxy every 1.5 seconds. Achievements are really important in this modification, as they hold valuable rewards to push further.</p>
<p>Getting to around e900+ IP should be fairly easy if you have saved up some EP and gotten some Eternities. You can get there at any point, however you should try to get it soon, setting replicanti power is very important for the future. Once you do reach the point where you can get 1 replicanti galaxy in under 1.5 seconds (e950+ IP), you're set.</p>
<p>Note: You can get 10 replicanti galaxies in 15 seconds, if you have 1.79e308 replicanti before the next Infinity and have all replicanti upgrades available at e930 IP, and attempt to hold down hotkeys. This is possible without having to get 100 Eternities or the 4th Time Dimension, but doing this before those points will be significantly slower and is not recommended. You should attempt to get the achievement when you are really prepared and can get lots of IP early on more easily.</p>
<p>If you haven't gotten at least 100 Eternities yet, consider doing so, as it will help with making Eternity Upgrade 2 stronger and get the "This mile took an eternity" achievement for more progression. Start getting more EP, as usual; The Fourth Time Dimension should soon be easily obtainable with 1,000 EP, which can be easily obtained from the 5x EP upgrade you can get.</p>
<h4>How to control replicanti galaxy power</h4>
<p>Upon getting the "The swarm" achievement, you unlock settings for how strong your replicanti galaxies can be, with two boxes for showing power and how much replicanti is needed. You can set RG power to whatever you want. However, setting the RG power to a higher number will increase the replicanti required, as having it still cost 1.79e308 replicanti would be too overpowered, meaning you will have to wait longer to get 1 replicanti galaxy. This means you must set your RG power wisely, as you want to make your replicanti galaxies more powerful while still having a reasonable replicanti goal.<br></p>
<p>The formula for replicanti required based on RG power is 2^2^(x*10).</p>
