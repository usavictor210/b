      <div align="center">August 18th, 2020</div>
      <div align="center">
      Long ago, dan-simon made a modification of Antimatter Dimensions named Eternity Respecced.<br><br>
      It has been many months, 2 years since then. In November 2018, dan-simon proceeded to delete the repository of /b...<br>
      ...not before the repository was passed onto me.<br>
      And so, it began.<br>
      After a long time, the Intergalactic update is finally complete, with much needed balance changes.<br><br>
      <b>INTERGALACTIC: It's finally here</b><br>
      <div align="center">Major stuff:</div>
      - Galactic Studies and Milestones, introducing even more automation than before.<br>
      - ...yes, there are more Dimensions too. Galactic Dimensions.<br>
      - There is also some obvious intergalactic statistics, I won't go into detail too much since we all know them at this point.<br>
      - 8 MORE ETERNITY CHALLENGES (you heard that right, EIGHT of them). After their 5th completion, Eternity Challenges can be attempted again to complete the challenge as fast as possible.<br>
      - TWO MORE ACHIEVEMENT ROWS, and a lot more new achievement images (and maybe more...? Play the game to find out! Or just search in the game repository, whatever floats your boat).<br>
      - Still no unfair scaling (we promise).<br>
      - A offical guide has been added that goes to the current endgame of this game (written by usavictor).<br>
      - Many rewords and code changes have been applied to make the game more understandable.<br>
      - Smarter max all: Max all now focuses on the higher tier dimensions first, then buys the dimensions from 1st tier to highest tier.<br>
      - <i>Time is relative</i> now has a reward giving a multiplier to Normal Dimensions based on time spent in this Eternity (effect is normally capped at 1e33x, but gets stronger as you get more Eternities. Hardcap is 1e100x).<br><b>In addition, you can automatically complete ICs based on your Eternities (IC1 = 1 eternity, IC2 = 2 eternities, and so on).</b><br>
      - Made the statistics screen and all subtabs neater.<br>
      <br>
      <b>BUGFIXES</b><br>
      - Fixed an uncaught fatal bug where TT would go NaN if you imported something that wasn't a number in one of the time study amounts<br>
      <br>
      <b>OTHER, aka Minor stuff</b><br>
      - Also added an update to False AD because people really needed it (yes, I hear you).<br>
      <b>FALSE AD UPDATE: ETERNITY EXPANSION</b>
      - The game now has balanced content beyond Eternity.<br>
      - Something else...<br><br>
      - Added and removed Time Dilation.<br>
      - Replicanti Power is now displayed in the Replicantis tab once you unlock it from "The swarm".<br>
      - Made the Ascendant 90.01% less powerful. Dang you triangles!<br>
      - Made replicanti goal more accurate and account for RG power changes. This means it will no longer refer to Infinity as your goal. There is also a date and time when you get your replicanti galaxies.<br>
      - Walderp now creates a 100 meter steam explosion.<br>
      - You are now able to see the first 2 decimals of your replicanti amount below 100 (this is toggleable).<br>
      - Minecraft is now renamed to Ourcraft.<br>
      - The Time Study Spec calculator is now implemented in the game itself.<br>
      - Accidentally patched the BLJ. This is (not) intended.<br>
      - Bulk buy is now capped at 1e10x, because who really needs 1e100x bulk buy now?<br>
      - <strike>Definitely did not steal the idea of creating silly patch notes to the game from the original Antimatter Dimensions chang-</strike> Shh, they're not supposed to find out!<br>
      - Fixed the IP peak/min. In fact, all peak statistics have been fixed. Hooray!<br>
      - R220 no longer follows the conventional rule of Ascensions. There are now Transcensions with Omega Coins.<br>
      - The bulk buy Dimension Boost upgrade now lets you buy max Dimension Boosts possible manually.<br>
      - Javascript consoles now proceed to give you errors periodically when producing cookies. Their cookies taste awful.<br>
      - Max all Infinity Dimension button has been added for a needed QoL change.<br>
      - Theta Energy now heats up all your Matter Condensers and may explode them in the process.<br>
      - Removed and added some news tickers. These will not be named for respectful reasons.<br>
      - There is now a Row 7, but it is really just the Ultraspace.<br>
      - Changed the changelog a bit throughout some of the commits. You're welcome.<br>
      - Halated snow. <i>Snow halation</i> in [REDACTED] mode is now available.<br>
      - Added more information about Eternity Challenges in its tab.<br>
      - The Incrementyverse has been replaced with a big inflated time wall.<br>
      - Gonna fix notation display (WIP)<br>
      - Removed <strike>the 9th Di-</strike> Herobrine<br>
      - Made replicate chance autobuyer more efficient, causing it to not lag the game every few seconds.<br>
      - Wow! Cubes now make the game go "Wow!" by proceeding to make the game a lootbox.<br>
      - Added an indicator to tell you your EC completions in total and if you've completed an EC.<br>
      - Unclogging Aarex's contributions to NG+3<br>
      - Worth the wait<br>
