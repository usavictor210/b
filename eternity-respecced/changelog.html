      Long ago, dan-simon made a modification of Antimatter Dimensions named Eternity Respecced.<br><br>
      It has been many months, 2 years since then. In November 2018, dan-simon proceeded to delete the repository of /b...<br>
      ...not before the repository was passed onto me.<br>
      And so, it began.<br>
      After a long time, the Intergalactic update is finally in development, with much needed balance changes.<br><br>
      <b>INTERGALACTIC: It's finally here</b><br>
      - Galactic studies and milestones with even more automation than before<br>
      - ...yes, there are more Dimensions too. Galactic Dimensions.<br>
      - There is also some obvious intergalactic statistics, I won't go into detail too much since we all know them at this point<br>
      - 8 MORE ETERNITY CHALLENGES (you heard that right, EIGHT of them). <br>After their 5th completion, Eternity Challenges can be attempted again in Time Trial mode to complete the challenge as fast as possible.<br>
      - Still no unfair scaling (we promise)<br>
      - TWO MORE ACHIEVEMENT ROWS, and a lot more new achievement images<br>
      - Many rewords and code changes to make the game more understandable<br>
      - Bulk buy is now capped at 1e10x, because who really needs 1e100x bulk buy now?<br>
      - Max all Infinity Dimension button has been added for a needed QoL change.<br>
      - The bulk buy Dimension Boost upgrade now lets you buy max Dimension Boosts possible manually<br>
      - Fixed the IP peak/min. In fact, all peak statistics have been fixed.<br>
      - Removed and added some news tickers<br>
      - Changed some text font displays<br>
      - <i>Time is relative</i> now has a reward giving a multiplier to Normal Dimensions based on time spent in this Eternity (effect is normally capped at 1e33x, but gets stronger as you get more Eternities. Hardcap is 1e100x).<br>
      - Made the statistics screen and all subtabs neater.<br>
      <br>
      <b>OTHER</b><br>
      - Also added an update to False AD because people really needed it (yes, I hear you)<br><br>
