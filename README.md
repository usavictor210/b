I cleaned this part up so people reading this file would be better informed about what this was.
This was dan-simon's old /b repository before he decided to delete it. Ever since he deleted his repositories back when he was still developing Eternity Respecced, it turned out that the ownership had been given to me because of how GitHub chooses [one fork at random to be the main repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/what-happens-to-forks-when-a-repository-is-deleted-or-changes-visibility).

Since then, I have tried (and failed) to work on the various projects in here, most notably Eternity Respecced. One day, Intergalactic might see the light.

For ng-update, Aarex had forked the repository right before the original repository was deleted, so it exists [here](https://aarextiaokhiao.github.io/b/ng-update/).

Original description:

This repository just contains random stuff. It's like evil-misc, but unlike there, here the stuff is at least somewhat polished, intended to have a short URL, hosted by Github Pages. This sounds like the criteria for stuff meant for public consumption, and that's kind of the distinction.

In reality, this repository will probably end up being whatever it needs to be to prevent creation of additional repositories with nothing of interest to anyone.

Oh, and since you actually read the README: the solution to f'(x) = e^f(x) is -ln(-x) for x < 0.
