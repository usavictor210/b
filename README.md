6/12/2020: As part of the paradigm shift of the development of NG+3.1, it is likely ER will be finished with Intergalactic.
All credits go to dan-simon for making the original Intergalactic content.

12/30/2018: The intergalactic update is coming. Soon.

usavictor, 11/3/18: I now own /b, originally owned by dan-simon until he deleted the original repository. Since I had one of the only forks, by randomness, ownership was transferred to me. THIS MEANS ETERNITY RESPECCED IS NOW OWNED BY ME (well basically everything in here is maintained by me now)

Original description:

This repository just contains random stuff. It's like evil-misc, but unlike there, here the stuff is at least somewhat polished, intended to have a short URL, hosted by Github Pages. This sounds like the criteria for stuff meant for public consumption, and that's kind of the distinction.

In reality, this repository will probably end up being whatever it needs to be to prevent creation of additional repositories with nothing of interest to anyone.

Oh, and since you actually read the README: the solution to f'(x) = e^f(x) is -ln(-x) for x < 0.
